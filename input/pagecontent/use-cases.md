### Overview

[The Shared Digital Health Record (SDHR) API](https://apistandards.digital.health.nz/api-concepts/ComponentDefinitions#api-provider) allows collection of a patient's clinical information from ministry, primary and secondary care systems, allowing information to be surfaced back to [authorised health sector](https://apistandards.digital.health.nz/api-concepts/ComponentDefinitions#health-workers) [API consumers](https://apistandards.digital.health.nz/api-concepts/ComponentDefinitions#api-consumer).


This IG is a Draft only. Please be aware it is subject to change. Profiles are being updated regularly. Please do not rely on the current version for development decisions.

### Data provision

When a patient's record is created or updated in a system of record for an encounter, allergy/intolerance, condition, or observation, FHIR resources representing this information should be POSTed or PUT to the API. 

This should be performed synchronously as soon as the change is made to the record.
